My name is Paul Wilson studying bachelor of technology in electronics and communication stream
at VASIREDDY **VENKATADRI INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY** at nambur ,Guntur.

> I have attended a workshop on "Basics of Fundamentals of Deep Learning" conducted by Nvidia certified 
tutor **Mr.M.PARDHASARADHI sir**

Got to learn more in that workshop about deep learning 

> A two workshop started with the history and classification of deep learning
by **Dr.Y.MALLIKARJUNA REDDY sir**

Then learned about neural networks .A great lecture to hear by **Dr.K.GIRI BABU** sir 

After having a break,another lecture filled with fun and knowledge by Mr.PARDHA SARADHI sir on the topic 
LEARNING and TRAINING 

At the day ,each of us given five tasks tone completed to get a certificate from Nvidia 

Finally ,I got it. Thanks for the lovely two day workshop which is a huge memory for me in  
my second year of graduation 

And earned my first [digital certificate](https://courses.nvidia.com/certificates/5843320f24b84c3dbb9984056e16003e)



Attended ***AI bootcamp*** on 11th of november which is a continuation to the workshop 
Here in this seven day bootcamp Ideas able to learn more about the  deep learning and I have run some programs 
on classification,resnet,etc on Jupyter notebook

In this bootcamp i had met with many fellomates who turned as friends at the end of the bootcamp

Here we have learned many things about installation of [**Keras**](https://keras.io/about/) [Tensorflow ](https://www.tensorflow.org/) anaconda environment


After installation we had run programs on image classification and Boston house pricing  and we have got to know 
about the framework of tensorflow developed by Microsoft 

We have made our own chatbots under the guidance of Dr.BHANUMURTHY sir which helped us in refreshing from the world 
of programming .We have developed those chatbots by using IBM WATSON

The very exciting  bootcamp ended with the guest lecture of Dr.PRADEEP KUMAR who works as a assistant professor at IIM Shillong
who gave us a glimpse of artificial intelligence and told us about his career


After conclusion of seven day bootcamp we had  given many resources in gaining knowledge in the stream of artificial intelligence

Our branch i.e, ECE went for a memorable industrial tour to kondapalli, Vijayawada and nambur AM(amplitude modulation)and FM(frequency modulation)
stations where we came across studios ,receivers and transmitters in all stations on 19th and 20th of February

Our college had conducted a project expo for 2nd and 3rd years of all departments in our college
I was very excited to see my output showing to many students and respected faculty 
I with my batch mates done a mobile phone detector which detects the presence of a mobile phone in the range of the circuit
Afterwards I had went to watch my senior projects who did their projects using  raspberry pi.There are about 50 projects displayed 
in which I loved 3 projects which are namely a frequency transmitter ,automation 
and a overhead tank motorusing sensor 

There are many robotic projects also which caught the eyes of visitors 

When coming to the 2nd projects my friends made a huge effort in building a bus which is capable of reducing damage after an accident 
and the other is a chatbot prepared for our college by my friend using IBM WATSON

And the department of CSE had a great projects too
In which I liked a project by 3rd year students in recognising objects which 
is a class under deep learning .They have used tensorflow and COCO dataset in their project
